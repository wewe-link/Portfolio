# OCR_model_for_lab
This is a draft I prepared while analyzing experimental data. The main challenge arose because no one in the lab knew how to record data from an old device directly in digital format. As a result, our team resorted to capturing the readings on phones as videos. To streamline the process of converting this data into a usable format, I explored training an OCR model.
