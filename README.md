# OCR_model_for_lab
This is a draft I prepared while analyzing experimental data. The main challenge arose because no one in the lab knew how to record data from an old device directly in digital format. As a result, our team resorted to capturing the readings on phones as videos. To streamline the process of converting this data into a usable format, I explored training an OCR model.\

The algorithm is fully described in the attached PDF report.

# Separating_two_star_clasters
Here, I attempt to separate two 2D normal distributions, representing star clusters. Two different approaches are employed:

- Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)
- Expectation-Maximization (EM)
